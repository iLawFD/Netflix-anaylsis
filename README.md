# This is a beginder friendly notebook for data scientists. We will be exploring the Netflix user base data set

# Exploring:
- First i tried to Explore the dataset, the coulmns, and their data types
- I created the 'days' column which represnt the subcribtion's period
# Data analysis
- I tried to relate the days column with every other column and found that it varies with country colum
-  I then tried to Explore the subcribtion type based on the country column by bar plot, and found many intersting notes that needed to be studied:
      - The most important note to take was:  All of Austrila , Mexico and the United Kingdom have the same number of members in this data set. However,  according to the plot, Austrila had most of its subscription's type to be premium while in mexico and the UK there were not any premium subscibers.
