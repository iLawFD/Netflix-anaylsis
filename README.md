# This is a beginder friendly notebook for data scientists. We will be exploring the Netflix user base data set

# Exploring:
- First i tried to Explore the dataset, the coulmns, and their data types
- I created the 'days' column which represnt the subcribtion's period
# Data analysis
- I tried to relate the days column with every other column and found that it varies with country colum
-  I then tried to Explore the subcribtion type based on the country column by bar plot, and found many intersting notes that needed to be studied:
      - The most important note to take was:  All of Austrila , Mexico and the United Kingdom have the same number of members in this data set. However,  according to the plot, Austrila had most of its subscription's type to be premium while in mexico and the UK there were not any premium subscibers
  ## Why Australia has most of its subcribtion's type to be premium while Mexico and the UK had no premium members?
- After Exploring more, i found that  the UK and Mexico have more older netflix members than Australia. This could be intrepreted as: younger people                  tend to buy premium more often than older people do (at least in this data set).

  -  This implies that Netflix might consider adding new features to the premium subscriton in such way that it attracts older people more , spicialy those in the UK and Mexico.
